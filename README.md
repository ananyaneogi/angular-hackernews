# Hackernews Client in Angular 6

This is a hackernews client like hundreds other available. I'm doing this mainly to experiment with a lot of concepts related to Angular and improving performance of a web app.


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.1.
